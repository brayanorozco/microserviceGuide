# Node Basic

* Dependencies: express, cors (avoid blocking requests), morgan,dotenv (It's very useful with
enviroment variables), helmet (a very useful tool for protecting the HTTP server we are going to create),
socket.io,socket.io/redis-adapter.

* Since we are going to use Bable, it's needed to install the following liraries: coreJS and runtime.
It's going to give us the posibility of working with asynchronous code. 

* Libraries as devDependencies:
